The previous description of the tools of data science is organised roughly according to the order in which you use them in an analysis (although of course you'll iterate through them multiple times). In our experience, however, this is not the best way to learn them:

* Starting with data ingest and tidying is sub-optimal because 80% of the time 
  it's routine and boring, and the other 20% of the time it's weird and
  frustrating. That's a bad place to start learning a new subject! Instead, 
  we'll start with visualisation and transformation of data that's already been
  imported and tidied. That way, when you ingest and tidy your own data, your
  motivation will stay high because you know the pain is worth it.
  
* Some topics are best explained with other tools. For example, we believe that
  it's easier to understand how models work if you already know about 
  visualisation, tidy data, and programming.
  
* Programming tools are not necessarily interesting in their own right, 
  but do allow you to tackle considerably more challenging problems. We'll
  give you a selection of programming tools in the middle of the book, and 
  then you'll see how they can combine with the data science tools to tackle 
  interesting modelling problems.

Within each chapter, we try and stick to a similar pattern: start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you've learned. While it's tempting to skip the exercises, there's no better way to learn than practicing on real problems.
