Almost all of the functions that you'll use in this book produce tibbles, as tibbles are one of the unifying features of the tidyverse. Most other R packages use regular data frames, so you might want to coerce a data frame to a tibble. You can do that with `as_tibble()`:


```r
as_tibble(iris)
#> # A tibble: 150 x 5
#>   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
#>          <dbl>       <dbl>        <dbl>       <dbl> <fct>  
#> 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa 
#> 2          4.9         3            1.4         0.2 setosa 
#> 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2 setosa 
#> 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2 setosa 
#> 5          5           3.6          1.4         0.2 setosa 
#> 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa 
#> # ... with 144 more rows
```

You can create a new tibble from individual vectors with `tibble()`. `tibble()` will automatically recycle inputs of length 1, and allows you to refer to variables that you just created, as shown below.


```r
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 3
#>       x     y     z
#>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1     1     1     2
#> 2     2     1     5
#> 3     3     1    10
#> 4     4     1    17
#> 5     5     1    26
```

If you're already familiar with `data.frame()`, note that `tibble()` does much less: it never changes the type of the inputs (e.g. it never converts strings to factors!), it never changes the names of variables, and it never creates row names.

It's possible for a tibble to have column names that are not valid R variable names, aka __non-syntactic__ names. For example, they might not start with a letter, or they might contain unusual characters like a space. To refer to these variables, you need to surround them with backticks, `` ` ``:


```r
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
#> # A tibble: 1 x 3
#>   `:)`  ` `   `2000`
#>   <chr> <chr> <chr> 
#> 1 smile space number
```

You'll also need the backticks when working with these variables in other packages, like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr.

Another way to create a tibble is with `tribble()`, short for **tr**ansposed tibble.  `tribble()` is customised for data entry in code: column headings are defined by formulas (i.e. they start with `~`), and entries are separated by commas. This makes it possible to lay out small amounts of data in easy to read form.


```r
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 3
#>   x         y     z
#>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 a         2   3.6
#> 2 b         1   8.5
```

I often add a comment (the line starting with `#`), to make it really clear where the header is.
