As you start to run R code, you're likely to run into problems. Don't worry --- it happens to everyone. I have been writing R code for years, and every day I still write code that doesn't work! 

Start by carefully comparing the code that you're running to the code in the book. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference. Make sure that every `(` is matched with a `)` and every `"` is paired with another `"`. Sometimes you'll run the code and nothing happens. Check the left-hand of your console: if it's a `+`, it means that R doesn't think you've typed a complete expression and it's waiting for you to finish it. In this case, it's usually easy to start from scratch again by pressing ESCAPE to abort processing the current command.

One common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the `+` in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start. In other words, make sure you haven't accidentally written code like this:

```R
ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

If you're still stuck, try the help. You can get help about any R function by running `?function_name` in the console, or selecting the function name and pressing F1 in RStudio. Don't worry if the help doesn't seem that helpful - instead skip down to the examples and look for code that matches what you're trying to do.

If that doesn't help, carefully read the error message. Sometimes the answer will be buried there! But when you're new to R, the answer might be in the error message but you don't yet know how to understand it. Another great tool is Google: try googling the error message, as it's likely someone else has had the same problem, and has gotten help online.
