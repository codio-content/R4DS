In summary, RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:

* Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project. 

* Keep data files there; we'll talk about loading them into R in 
  [data import].

* Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.

* Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.

* Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.

Everything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all the other projects that you are working on.
