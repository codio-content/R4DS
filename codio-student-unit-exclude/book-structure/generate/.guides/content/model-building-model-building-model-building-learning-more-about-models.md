We have only scratched the absolute surface of modelling, but you have hopefully gained some simple, but general-purpose tools that you can use to improve your own data analyses. It's OK to start simple! As you've seen, even very simple models can make a dramatic difference in your ability to tease out interactions between variables.

These modelling chapters are even more opinionated than the rest of the book. I approach modelling from a somewhat different perspective to most others, and there is relatively little space devoted to it. Modelling really deserves a book on its own, so I'd highly recommend that you read at least one of these three books:

* *Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach* by Danny Kaplan,
  <http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/>. This book provides 
  a gentle introduction to modelling, where you build your intuition,
  mathematical tools, and R skills in parallel. The book replaces a traditional
  "introduction to statistics" course, providing a curriculum that is up-to-date 
  and relevant to data science.

* *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, 
  Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, <http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/> 
  (available online for free). This book presents a family of modern modelling
  techniques collectively known as statistical learning.  For an even deeper
  understanding of the math behind the models, read the classic 
  *Elements of Statistical Learning* by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and
  Jerome Friedman, <https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf> (also
  available online for free).

* *Applied Predictive Modeling* by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson, 
  <http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com>. This book is a companion to the 
  __caret__ package and provides practical tools for dealing with real-life
  predictive modelling challenges.
