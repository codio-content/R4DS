Now that you are equipped with powerful programming tools we can finally return to modelling. You'll use your new tools of data wrangling and programming, to fit many models and understand how they work. The focus of this book is on exploration, not confirmation or formal inference. But you'll learn a few basic tools that help you understand the variation within your models.

The goal of a model is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. Ideally, the model will capture true "signals" (i.e. patterns generated by the phenomenon of interest), and ignore "noise" (i.e. random variation that you're not interested in). Here we only cover "predictive" models, which, as the name suggests, generate predictions. There is another type of model that we're not going to discuss: "data discovery" models. These models don't make predictions, but instead help you discover interesting relationships within your data. (These two categories of models are sometimes called supervised and unsupervised, but I don't think that terminology is particularly illuminating.)

This book is not going to give you a deep understanding of the mathematical theory that underlies models. It will, however, build your intuition about how statistical models work, and give you a family of useful tools that allow you to use models to better understand your data:

* In [model basics], you'll learn how models work mechanistically, focussing on
  the important family of linear models. You'll learn general tools for gaining
  insight into what a predictive model tells you about your data, focussing on
  simple simulated datasets.

* In [model building], you'll learn how to use models to pull out known
  patterns in real data. Once you have recognised an important pattern
  it's useful to make it explicit in a model, because then you can
  more easily see the subtler signals that remain.

* In [many models], you'll learn how to use many simple models to help 
  understand complex datasets. This is a powerful technique, but to access
  it you'll need to combine modelling and programming tools.

These topics are notable because of what they don't include: any tools for quantitatively assessing models. That is deliberate: precisely quantifying a model requires a couple of big ideas that we just don't have the space to cover here. For now, you'll rely on qualitative assessment and your natural scepticism. In [Learning more about models], we'll point you to other resources where you can learn more.
