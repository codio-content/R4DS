This book isn't just the product of Hadley and Garrett, but is the result of many conversations (in person and online) that we've had with the many people in the R community. There are a few people we'd like to thank in particular, because they have spent many hours answering our dumb questions and helping us to better think about data science:

* Jenny Bryan and Lionel Henry for many helpful discussions around working
  with lists and list-columns.
  
* The three chapters on workflow were adapted (with permission), from
  <http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html> by 
  Jenny Bryan.

* Genevera Allen for discussions about models, modelling, the statistical
  learning perspective, and the difference between hypothesis generation and 
  hypothesis confirmation.

* Yihui Xie for his work on the [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) 
  package, and for tirelessly responding to my feature requests.

* Bill Behrman for his thoughtful reading of the entire book, and for trying 
  it out with his data science class at Stanford.

* The \#rstats twitter community who reviewed all of the draft chapters
  and provided tons of useful feedback.

* Tal Galili for augmenting his dendextend package to support a section on clustering that did not make it into the final draft.

This book was written in the open, and many people contributed pull requests to fix minor problems. Special thanks goes to everyone who contributed via GitHub:
