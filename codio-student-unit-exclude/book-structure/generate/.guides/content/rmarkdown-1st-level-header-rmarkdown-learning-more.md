R Markdown is still relatively young, and is still growing rapidly. The best place to stay on top of innovations is the official R Markdown website: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

There are two important topics that we haven't covered here: collaboration, and the details of accurately communicating your ideas to other humans. Collaboration is a vital part of modern data science, and you can make your life much easier by using version control tools, like Git and GitHub. We recommend two free resources that will teach you about Git:

1.  "Happy Git with R": a user friendly introduction to Git and GitHub from 
    R users, by Jenny Bryan. The book is freely available online:
    <http://happygitwithr.com>
    
1.  The "Git and GitHub" chapter of _R Packages_, by Hadley. You can also 
    read it for free online: <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html>.

I have also not touched on what you should actually write in order to clearly communicate the results of your analysis. To improve your writing, I highly recommend reading either [_Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace_](https://amzn.com/0134080416) by Joseph M. Williams & Joseph Bizup, or [_The Sense of Structure: Writing from the Reader's Perspective_](https://amzn.com/0205296327) by George Gopen. Both books will help you understand the structure of sentences and paragraphs, and give you the tools to make your writing more clear. (These books are rather expensive if purchased new, but they're used by many English classes so there are plenty of cheap second-hand copies). George Gopen also has a number of short articles on writing at <https://www.georgegopen.com/the-litigation-articles.html>. They are aimed at lawyers, but almost everything applies to data scientists too.
