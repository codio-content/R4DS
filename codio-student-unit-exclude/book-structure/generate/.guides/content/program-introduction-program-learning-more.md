The goal of these chapters is to teach you the minimum about programming that you need to practice data science, which turns out to be a reasonable amount. Once you have mastered the material in this book, I strongly believe you should invest further in your programming skills. Learning more about programming is a long-term investment: it won't pay off immediately, but in the long term it will allow you to solve new problems more quickly, and let you reuse your insights from previous problems in new scenarios.

To learn more you need to study R as a programming language, not just an interactive environment for data science. We have written two books that will help you do so:

* [_Hands on Programming with R_](https://amzn.com/1449359019),
  by Garrett Grolemund. This is an introduction to R as a programming language 
  and is a great place to start if R is your first programming language. It 
  covers similar material to these chapters, but with a different style and
  different motivation examples (based in the casino). It's a useful complement 
  if you find that these four chapters go by too quickly.
  
* [_Advanced R_](https://amzn.com/1466586966) by Hadley Wickham. This dives into the
  details of R the programming language. This is a great place to start if you
  have existing programming experience. It's also a great next step once you've 
  internalised the ideas in these chapters. You can read it online at
