To learn more about effective communication in these different formats I recommend the following resources:

* To improve your presentation skills, I recommend 
  [_Presentation Patterns_](https://amzn.com/0321820800), by Neal Ford,
  Matthew McCollough, and Nathaniel Schutta. It provides a set of effective
  patterns (both low- and high-level) that you can apply to improve your 
  presentations.
  
* If you give academic talks, I recommend reading the [_Leek group guide
  to giving talks_](https://github.com/jtleek/talkguide).
  
* I haven't taken it myself, but I've heard good things about Matt 
  McGarrity's online course on public speaking: 
  <https://www.coursera.org/learn/public-speaking>.

* If you are creating a lot of dashboards, make sure to read Stephen Few's
  [Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication 
  of Data](https://amzn.com/0596100167). It will help you create dashboards
  that are truly useful, not just pretty to look at.

* Effectively communicating your ideas often benefits from some
  knowledge of graphic design. [_The Non-Designer's Design
  Book_](http://amzn.com/0133966151) is a great place to start.
