One day you will need to quit R, go do something else and return to your analysis the next day. One day you will be working on multiple analyses simultaneously that all use R and you want to keep them separate. One day you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world. To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

1.  What about your analysis is "real", i.e. what will you save as your 
    lasting record of what happened?

1.  Where does your analysis "live"?
