R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more. 

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

1.  For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions,
    not the code behind the analysis.

1.  For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!), who
    are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e.
    the code).
    
1.  As an environment in which to _do_ data science, as a modern day lab 
    notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you
    were thinking.

R Markdown integrates a number of R packages and external tools. This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through `?`. Instead, as you work through this chapter, and use R Markdown in the future, keep these resources close to hand:

*   R Markdown Cheat Sheet: _Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Cheat Sheet_,

*   R Markdown Reference Guide: _Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference 
    Guide_.

Both cheatsheets are also available at <http://rstudio.com/cheatsheets>.

### Prerequisites

You need the __rmarkdown__ package, but you don't need to explicitly install it or load it, as RStudio automatically does both when needed.
