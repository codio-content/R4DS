The absolute best place to learn more is the ggplot2 book: [_ggplot2: Elegant graphics for data analysis_](https://amzn.com/331924275X). It goes into much more depth about the underlying theory, and has many more examples of how to combine the individual pieces to solve practical problems. Unfortunately, the book is not available online for free, although you can find the source code at <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>.

Another great resource is the ggplot2 extensions guide <http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/>. This site lists many of the packages that extend ggplot2 with new geoms and scales. It's a great place to start if you're trying to do something that seems hard with ggplot2.
