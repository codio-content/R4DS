More powerful than changing the orders of the levels is changing their values. This allows you to clarify labels for publication, and collapse levels for high-level displays. The most general and powerful tool is `fct_recode()`. It allows you to recode, or change, the value of each level. For example, take the `gss_cat$partyid`:


```r
gss_cat %>% count(partyid)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 2
#>   partyid                n
#>   <fct>              <int>
#> 1 No answer            154
#> 2 Don't know             1
#> 3 Other party          393
#> 4 Strong republican   2314
#> 5 Not str republican  3032
#> 6 Ind,near rep        1791
#> # ... with 4 more rows
```
{Run code | terminal}(Rscript code/gss.r)              


The levels are terse and inconsistent. Let's tweak them to be longer and use a parallel construction.


```r
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 2
#>   partyid                   n
#>   <fct>                 <int>
#> 1 No answer               154
#> 2 Don't know                1
#> 3 Other party             393
#> 4 Republican, strong     2314
#> 5 Republican, weak       3032
#> 6 Independent, near rep  1791
#> # ... with 4 more rows
```

`fct_recode()` will leave levels that aren't explicitly mentioned as is, and will warn you if you accidentally refer to a level that doesn't exist.

To combine groups, you can assign multiple old levels to the same new level:


```r
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,
    "Republican, strong"    = "Strong republican",
    "Republican, weak"      = "Not str republican",
    "Independent, near rep" = "Ind,near rep",
    "Independent, near dem" = "Ind,near dem",
    "Democrat, weak"        = "Not str democrat",
    "Democrat, strong"      = "Strong democrat",
    "Other"                 = "No answer",
    "Other"                 = "Don't know",
    "Other"                 = "Other party"
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
#> # A tibble: 8 x 2
#>   partyid                   n
#>   <fct>                 <int>
#> 1 Other                   548
#> 2 Republican, strong     2314
#> 3 Republican, weak       3032
#> 4 Independent, near rep  1791
#> 5 Independent            4119
#> 6 Independent, near dem  2499
#> # ... with 2 more rows
```
{Run code | terminal}(Rscript code/gss.r)              


You must use this technique with care: if you group together categories that are truly different you will end up with misleading results.

If you want to collapse a lot of levels, `fct_collapse()` is a useful variant of `fct_recode()`. For each new variable, you can provide a vector of old levels:


```r
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,
    other = c("No answer", "Don't know", "Other party"),
    rep = c("Strong republican", "Not str republican"),
    ind = c("Ind,near rep", "Independent", "Ind,near dem"),
    dem = c("Not str democrat", "Strong democrat")
  )) %>%
  count(partyid)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 2
#>   partyid     n
#>   <fct>   <int>
#> 1 other     548
#> 2 rep      5346
#> 3 ind      8409
#> 4 dem      7180
```

Sometimes you just want to lump together all the small groups to make a plot or table simpler. That's the job of `fct_lump()`:


```r
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig)) %>%
  count(relig)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 2
#>   relig          n
#>   <fct>      <int>
#> 1 Protestant 10846
#> 2 Other      10637
```

The default behaviour is to progressively lump together the smallest groups, ensuring that the aggregate is still the smallest group. In this case it's not very helpful: it is true that the majority of Americans in this survey are Protestant, but we've probably over collapsed.

Instead, we can use the `n` parameter to specify how many groups (excluding other) we want to keep:


```r
gss_cat %>%
  mutate(relig = fct_lump(relig, n = 10)) %>%
  count(relig, sort = TRUE) %>%
  print(n = Inf)
#> # A tibble: 10 x 2
#>    relig                       n
#>    <fct>                   <int>
#>  1 Protestant              10846
#>  2 Catholic                 5124
#>  3 None                     3523
#>  4 Christian                 689
#>  5 Other                     458
#>  6 Jewish                    388
#>  7 Buddhism                  147
#>  8 Inter-nondenominational   109
#>  9 Moslem/islam              104
#> 10 Orthodox-christian         95
```
