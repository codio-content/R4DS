The goal of a model is to provide a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset. In the context of this book we're going to use models to partition data into patterns and residuals. Strong patterns will hide subtler trends, so we'll use models to help peel back layers of structure as we explore a dataset.

However, before we can start using models on interesting, real, datasets, you need to understand the basics of how models work. For that reason, this chapter of the book is unique because it uses only simulated datasets. These datasets are very simple, and not at all interesting, but they will help you understand the essence of modelling before you apply the same techniques to real data in the next chapter.

There are two parts to a model:

1.  First, you define a __family of models__ that express a precise, but 
    generic, pattern that you want to capture. For example, the pattern 
    might be a straight line, or a quadratic curve. You will express
    the model family as an equation like `y = a_1 * x + a_2` or 
    `y = a_1 * x ^ a_2`. Here, `x` and `y` are known variables from your
    data, and `a_1` and `a_2` are parameters that can vary to capture 
    different patterns.

1.  Next, you generate a __fitted model__ by finding the model from the 
    family that is the closest to your data. This takes the generic model 
    family and makes it specific, like `y = 3 * x + 7` or `y = 9 * x ^ 2`.

It's important to understand that a fitted model is just the closest model from a family of models. That implies that you have the "best" model (according to some criteria); it doesn't imply that you have a good model and it certainly doesn't imply that the model is "true". George Box puts this well in his famous aphorism:

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

It's worth reading the fuller context of the quote:

> For such a model there is no need to ask the question "Is the model true?". 
> If "truth" is to be the "whole truth" the answer must be "No". The only

The goal of a model is not to uncover truth, but to discover a simple approximation that is still useful. 

### Prerequisites

In this chapter we'll use the modelr package which wraps around base R's modelling functions to make them work naturally in a pipe.


```r
library(tidyverse)

library(modelr)
options(na.action = na.warn)
```
