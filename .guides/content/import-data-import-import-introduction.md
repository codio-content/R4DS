Working with data provided by R packages is a great way to learn the tools of data science, but at some point you want to stop learning and start working with your own data. In this chapter, you'll learn how to read plain-text rectangular files into R. Here, we'll only scratch the surface of data import, but many of the principles will translate to other forms of data. We'll finish with a few pointers to packages that are useful for other types of data.

### Prerequisites

In this chapter, you'll learn how to load flat files in R with the __readr__ package, which is part of the core tidyverse.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```
