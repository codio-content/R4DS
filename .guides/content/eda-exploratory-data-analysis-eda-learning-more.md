If you want to learn more about the mechanics of ggplot2, I'd highly recommend grabbing a copy of the ggplot2 book: <https://amzn.com/331924275X>. It's been recently updated, so it includes dplyr and tidyr code, and has much more space to explore all the facets of visualisation. Unfortunately the book isn't generally available for free, but if you have a connection to a university you can probably get an electronic version for free through SpringerLink.

Another useful resource is the [_R Graphics Cookbook_](https://amzn.com/1449316956) by Winston Chang. Much of the contents are available online at <http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/>.

I also recommend [_Graphical Data Analysis with R_](https://amzn.com/1498715230), by Antony Unwin. This is a book-length treatment similar to the material covered in this chapter, but has the space to go into much greater depth.
