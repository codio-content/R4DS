Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, `_` and `.`. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you'll need a convention for multiple words. I recommend __snake_case__ where you separate lowercase words with `_`. 


```r
i_use_snake_case
otherPeopleUseCamelCase
some.people.use.periods
And_aFew.People_RENOUNCEconvention
```

We'll come back to code style later, in [functions].

You can inspect an object by typing its name:


```r
x
#> [1] 12
```

Make another assignment:


```r
this_is_a_really_long_name <- 2.5
```

To inspect this object, try out RStudio's completion facility: type "this", press TAB, add characters until you have a unique prefix, then press return.

Ooops, you made a mistake! `this_is_a_really_long_name` should have value 3.5 not 2.5. Use another keyboard shortcut to help you fix it.  Type "this" then press Cmd/Ctrl + â†‘. That will list all the commands you've typed that start those letters. Use the arrow keys to navigate, then press enter to retype the command. Change 2.5 to 3.5 and rerun.

Make yet another assignment:


```r
r_rocks <- 2 ^ 3
```

Let's try to inspect it:


```r
r_rock
#> Error: object 'r_rock' not found
R_rocks
#> Error: object 'R_rocks' not found
```

There's an implied contract between you and R: it will do the tedious computation for you, but in return, you must be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters.
